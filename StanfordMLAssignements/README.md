List of Projects:

1) Logistic Regression
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
   
2) Multi-Class_Classification_and_NN
   - Using logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).

3) Neural Networks
   - Implemented feedforward propagation for neural networks and used it to predict handwritten digits with the weights provided.
   
4) Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
   - Implemented regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water fowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.
   - Diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms and examine the effects of bias v.s. variance.
   
5) Support Vector Machines
   - Built a Spam Classifier
   
6) K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
   - Implemented K-means algorithm for Image Compression
   
7) Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
   - Implement an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavious in server computers.
